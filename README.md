This web application predicts stock prices for the next 7 days using historical data from Yahoo Finance. The model uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), to make predictions based on the closing stock prices. It also incorporates moving averages (50-day and 200-day) to provide insights into long-term and short-term trends.

Features:
 Predicts stock prices for the next 7 days based on historical data.
 Visualizes the stock's closing prices and moving averages (SMA 50, SMA 200) for the last 6 months.
 LSTM model with adjustable hyperparameters (epochs and batch size).
 Displays performance metrics (R2 Score and RMSE) of the model.
